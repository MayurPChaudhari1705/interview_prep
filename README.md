# Interview Prep

This is a Next.js project that provides a demo interview platform with an AI mock interviewer. The AI interviewer is built using the [VAPI](https://github.com/vapi-ai/vapi) library and can be used to practice common interview questions in a variety of topics, including programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and more.

The project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and performance-optimized web applications. The AI interviewer is built using the VAPI library, which provides a simple and intuitive API for building conversational AI models.

The project is open source and can be used for free. It is also relatively easy to set up and customize, and can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Practicing common interview questions
* Preparing for technical interviews
* Improving communication skills
* Learning new technologies and programming languages

The project is also highly customizable, and can be used to build a wide range of AI-powered interview platforms. For example, you could use it to build a platform that focuses on a specific industry or topic, or one that provides more advanced features, such as video conferencing or real-time feedback.

Overall, the Interview Prep project is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their interview skills, or for anyone looking to build a custom AI-powered interview platform.
